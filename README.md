### What I learned

Learning how to use border-radius to create curved borders for the homepage container and the qr image was a bit challenging something new for me.

```css
.homepage {
   /* background-color: white;
   width: 620px; 
   margin: 100px auto; */

   /* This is the border-radius to create the curved corners of
      the container element */

   border-radius: 25px;
   
   /* padding:auto;
   padding-bottom: 5px;
   text-align:center; */
}

img {
   /* margin: 20px 10px; */

   /* This is the border-radius to create the curved corners of
      the QR image */

   border-radius: 25px;
}
```


### Continued development

I would like to work more on the margin and padding of certain elements contained in the divs I create.
